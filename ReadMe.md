# Invoice App Project

## Project Overview

This project is an Invoice App that I'm currently developing using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js). The project is based on a challenge from Frontend Mentor and aims to help users manage and track their invoices effectively.

## Key Features

- **Invoice Management**: Create, read, update, and delete invoices with ease.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various devices, ensuring a seamless experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- **Real-time Data Updates**: Leveraging WebSockets to provide real-time updates to invoice data.
- **Filtering and Sorting**: Advanced filtering and sorting options to quickly find and organize invoices.
- **Dashboard Overview**: A comprehensive dashboard displaying key invoice metrics and insights.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration system to protect user data(optional).

## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB**: For the database to store user and invoice data.
- **Express**: As the server framework to handle API requests and routes.
- **React**: For building the user interface with reusable components.
- **Node.js**: To run the server-side application.

## Learning and Development

As I work on this project, I'm deepening my understanding of the MERN stack and applying best practices in full-stack development. This project allows me to:

- Gain hands-on experience with MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js.
- Understand the principles of RESTful API design.
- Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- Enhance my skills in responsive web design and front-end development.
- Utilize modern development tools and workflows, including version control with Git and deployment with Vercel.
